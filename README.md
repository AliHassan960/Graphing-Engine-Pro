# Graphing-Engine-Pro
A high-performance, mobile-responsive graphing calculator built with HTML5 Canvas and JavaScript. Features real-time function plotting, calculus visualization (derivatives/integrals), data tables, and touch gestures.
# 📉 Ultimate Graphing Engine

A powerful, lightweight, and fully responsive graphing calculator built entirely with vanilla JavaScript and the HTML5 Canvas API. 

This engine is capable of rendering complex mathematical functions, visualizing calculus concepts (derivatives and integrals), and handling manual data point plotting—all in real-time.

## ✨ Features

* **🚀 High Performance:** Renders smooth graphs using the HTML5 Canvas API.
* **📱 Fully Responsive:** Optimized for Desktop, Tablet, and Mobile. Includes touch gesture support for panning and zooming.
* **🧮 Symbolic Math:** Powered by `math.js` to parse and handle complex equations (trigonometry, logs, exponents, etc.).
* **∫ Calculus Visualization:** * **Derivatives:** Visualizes the slope (f'(x)) in real-time (Pink dashed line).
    * **Integrals:** Visualizes the area under the curve (F(x)) (Amber dashed line).
* **📊 Data Tables:** Plot specific (x, y) points manually or auto-generate tables based on your equation.
* **🎨 Modern UI:** Clean dark mode interface with a collapsible sidebar, helper buttons, and interactive tooltips.
* **⚡ Zero-Install:** Runs directly in the browser. No backend or build step required.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Core:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)
* **Rendering:** HTML5 Canvas Context 2D
* **Math Library:** [Math.js](https://mathjs.org/) (via CDN)
